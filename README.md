## Description

This is a portfolio application to share my projects with both prospective employers, clients and other developers. By showvcasing my work, it can lead to potential future collaborations and projects.

## Installation

This is a single page application using React. The application is deployed using GitHub Pages.

## Preview & Usage

1. To run the build, npm run start to connect to a localhost.
